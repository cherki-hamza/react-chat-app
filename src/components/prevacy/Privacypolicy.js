                A privacy policy on your website is a legal document informing users about how you collect and handle their personal data, who you share it with, if you sell it, and any other relevant details.

                You might also call a privacy policy a:

                Privacy Agreement
                Privacy Clause
                Privacy Notice
                Privacy Page
                Privacy Policy Statement

                Specific platforms or services may also require a unique privacy policy template. Examples include:

                Mobile app privacy policies
                Privacy policies for Blogger
                WordPress privacy policies
                Ecommerce privacy policies
                Small Business privacy policies
                Email marketing privacy policy

                However, a standard privacy policy template will likely satisfy user demands and legal requirements for your website.

        </div>
    )
}
